### **5.3 Event Streaming vs Message Queues**

1. **Key Differences**
    - Event streaming: focus on replayability and ordering.
    - Message queues: focus on task distribution.
    - Use cases for each approach.
2. **Real-World Examples**
    - Event streaming: real-time analytics, log aggregation.
    - Message queues: email processing, background jobs.
3. **Hands-On Exercises**
    - Compare event streaming with Kafka to task processing in RabbitMQ.
    - Implement a use case for both and analyze their behavior.
