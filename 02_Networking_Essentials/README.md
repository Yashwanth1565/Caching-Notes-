   - Real-world examples of TCP/IP applications.
3. **Transport Layer Protocols**:
   - TCP: Features (connection-oriented, reliable delivery).
   - UDP: Features (connectionless, low latency).
   - Use cases for TCP vs UDP.
4. **Networking Basics**:
   - IP addressing (IPv4 and IPv6).
   - Subnetting and CIDR notation.
   - Basics of routing and NAT (Network Address Translation).
5. **Hands-On Exercises**:
   - Use tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets.
   - Set up a basic TCP and UDP server-client model using Python or Go.

### **2.2 HTTP/HTTPS Protocol**

1. **Basics of HTTP**:
   - HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
   - Structure of HTTP requests and responses (headers, body, status codes).
   - Persistent connections in HTTP/1.1.
2. **Introduction to HTTPS**:
   - How HTTPS secures communication (SSL/TLS).
   - Overview of certificates and Certificate Authorities (CAs).
   - HTTPS handshake process.
3. **Common HTTP Headers**:
   - Cache-Control, Authorization, Content-Type, Accept-Encoding, etc.
   - Importance of headers in system performance and security.
4. **RESTful APIs**:
   - Principles of REST.
   - Designing stateless, resource-oriented APIs.
5. **Hands-On Exercises**:
   - Use tools like Postman to send HTTP/HTTPS requests.
   - Set up an HTTPS server with a self-signed SSL certificate.

### **2.3 Load Balancers and Reverse Proxies**

1. **Introduction to Load Balancers**:
   - Role of load balancers in scalability and fault tolerance.
   - Types of load balancers: Layer 4 (Transport Layer) and Layer 7 (Application Layer).
2. **Reverse Proxies**:
   - What is a reverse proxy, and why is it used?
   - Common tools (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik).
   - Differences between load balancers and reverse proxies.
3. **Load Balancing Algorithms**:
   - Round-robin, least connections, IP hashing.
   - Pros and cons of each algorithm.
4. **Hands-On Exercises**:
   - Set up Nginx or HAProxy as a reverse proxy.
   - Implement load balancing for a simple web application.

### **2.4 DNS and CDN (Content Delivery Networks)**

1. **DNS Basics**:
   - What is DNS, and how does it work?
   - DNS records: A, CNAME, MX, TXT.
   - Recursive vs authoritative DNS servers.
2. **Introduction to CDNs**:
   - What is a CDN, and why is it important?
   - How CDNs cache and serve content closer to users.
   - Examples of CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai).
3. **DNS and CDN in Action**:
   - How CDNs use DNS to route traffic.
   - Techniques like geo-replication and edge caching.
4. **Hands-On Exercises**:
   - Use `dig` or `nslookup` to query DNS records.
   - Configure a CDN for a static website using AWS CloudFront or Cloudflare.

### **2.5 WebSockets and gRPC**

1. **Introduction to WebSockets**:
   - What are WebSockets, and how do they differ from HTTP?
   - Use cases for WebSockets (e.g., real-time chat, live notifications).
2. **Introduction to gRPC**:
   - What is gRPC, and how is it different from REST?
   - Role of Protocol Buffers (Protobuf).
   - Advantages of gRPC in high-performance systems.
3. **Comparison: WebSockets vs gRPC**:
   - Use cases, performance, and trade-offs.
4. **Hands-On Exercises**:
   - Create a WebSocket server and client using Python or Node.js.
   - Implement a gRPC service using Go or Python.

2. **Introduction to HTTP/3 and QUIC**:
   - What is QUIC, and how does it differ from TCP?
   - Benefits of HTTP/3: Reduced latency, improved reliability.
3. **Real-World Adoption**:
   - Examples of companies using HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (e.g., Google, Facebook).
   - Challenges in transitioning to HTTP/3.
4. **Hands-On Exercises**:
   - Use tools like `curl` or Chrome DevTools to analyze HTTP versions used by websites.
   - Set up a server that supports HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 (e.g., using Nginx or Caddy).
