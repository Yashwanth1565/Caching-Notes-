1. **What is Load Balancing?**
   - Definition and importance of load balancing in distributed systems.
   - Key benefits: scalability, fault tolerance, improved user experience.
2. **Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling**
   - Explanation of horizontal scaling (adding more servers).
   - Explanation of vertical scaling (upgrading existing servers).
   - Pros and cons of each scaling method.
   - Real-world scenarios for applying horizontal and vertical scaling.
3. **Key Challenges in Load Balancing**
   - Handling dynamic traffic patterns.
   - Ensuring low latency and high throughput.

### **6.2 Types of Load Balancers**

1. **Layer 4 Load Balancers (Transport Layer)**
   - How Layer 4 operates based on IP and TCP/UDP.
   - Examples: TCP proxying, direct server return (DSR).
   - Advantages: lightweight and fast.
2. **Layer 7 Load Balancers (Application Layer)**
   - How Layer 7 operates based on HTTP headers, cookies, and URLs.
   - Use cases: routing traffic to microservices, content-based routing.
   - Advantages: advanced routing and flexibility.
3. **Comparison of Layer 4 vs Layer 7**
   - Performance differences and overhead.
   - Use cases for each type.
4. **Hands-On Exercises**
   - Set up a Layer 4 load balancer with HAProxy.
   - Configure a Layer 7 load balancer with NGINX.

### **6.3 Load Balancing Algorithms**

1. **Overview of Load Balancing Algorithms**
   - Why algorithms matter for traffic distribution.
   - Metrics for choosing the right algorithm (e.g., server load, latency).
2. **Round Robin**
   - How it works: evenly distributing requests across servers.
   - Pros and cons: simplicity vs uneven load distribution.
3. **Least Connections**
   - Balancing based on the number of active connections.
   - Advantages for systems with varying request durations.
4. **Weighted Load Balancing**
   - Assigning weights to servers based on capacity or performance.
   - Dynamic vs static weighting.
5. **IP Hashing**
   - Ensuring consistent routing for client sessions.
   - Use cases: session stickiness and geographic routing.
6. **Hands-On Exercises**
   - Configure Round Robin and Least Connections in a load balancer.
   - Experiment with Weighted Load Balancing using NGINX or Traefik.

### **6.4 Global vs Local Load Balancers**

1. **Local Load Balancers**
   - Definition and use cases: managing traffic within a single data center.
   - Examples: NGINX, HAProxy.
2. **Global Load Balancers**
   - Definition and use cases: managing traffic across multiple regions.
   - Examples: AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Cloudflare.
   - Features: geographic routing, failover, disaster recovery.
3. **DNS-Based Load Balancing**
   - How DNS resolves to geographically closest servers.
   - Challenges: DNS caching, propagation delays.
4. **Hands-On Exercises**
   - Set up a local load balancer with HAProxy.
   - Configure global load balancing using AWS Route 53.

### **6.5 Autoscaling**

1. **Introduction to Autoscaling**
   - What is autoscaling, and why is it essential for traffic management?
   - Difference between reactive and predictive autoscaling.
2. **Autoscaling Strategies**
   - Horizontal scaling: adding/removing instances.
   - Vertical scaling: increasing/decreasing instance capacity.
   - Metrics-based scaling: CPU, memory, or request thresholds.
3. **Autoscaling in Cloud Environments**
   - AWS Auto Scaling.
   - Google Cloud Autoscaler.
   - Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
4. **Challenges and Best Practices**
   - Avoiding overprovisioning.
   - Balancing cost with performance.
5. **Hands-On Exercises**
   - Set up autoscaling on AWS with EC2.
   - Configure Kubernetes HPA for a microservices application.

### **6.6 Throttling and Rate Limiting**

1. **What is Throttling?**
   - Definition and importance of throttling in preventing abuse.
   - Use cases: APIs, login attempts, resource-heavy requests.
2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Defining limits based on users, IPs, or endpoints.
   - Fixed Window vs Sliding Window vs Token Bucket algorithms.
3. **Distributed Rate Limiting**
   - Challenges in implementing rate limiting in distributed systems.
   - Tools: Redis, API Gateways (e.g., Kong, AWS API Gateway).
4. **Handling Burst Traffic**
   - Implementing burst handling mechanisms.
   - Real-world examples: API traffic spikes during events.
5. **Hands-On Exercises**
   - Implement rate limiting with NGINX and Redis.
   - Configure throttling in an API Gateway like AWS API Gateway or Kong.
