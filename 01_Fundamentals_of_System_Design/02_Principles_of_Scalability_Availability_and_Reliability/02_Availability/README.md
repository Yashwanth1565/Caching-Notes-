## **2. Availability**

### **Availability in System Design**

### **1. Definition of Availability and Its Role in System Design**

**Definition:**

- Availability in system design refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible when required, ensuring that services are consistently available to users without significant interruptions.
- It is a critical aspect of ensuring user satisfaction and trust, particularly for systems requiring high uptime like e-commerce platforms, payment gateways, and healthcare applications.
- **Mathematically, availability is often expressed as:**
  Where:
  - **MTTF (Mean Time to Failure):** The average time a system operates before failing.
  - **MTTR (Mean Time to Repair):** The average time taken to restore the system after a failure.

**Role in System Design:**

- Ensures that critical systems, such as financial platforms or healthcare systems, can function without unacceptable interruptions.
- Impacts user experience and trust in the system, especially for business-critical or high-traffic platforms.
- Forms one of the pillars of system reliability, along with scalability and fault tolerance.

### **2. Understanding Uptime and SLA (Service Level Agreement)**

**Uptime:**

- Refers to the percentage of time a system is operational and accessible within a given period.
- Common uptime metrics include 99.9% ("three nines"), 99.99% ("four nines"), and 99.999% ("five nines"), which correspond to varying levels of downtime:
  - **99.9%:** ~8.76 hours of downtime per year.
  - **99.99%:** ~52.56 minutes of downtime per year.
  - **99.999%:** ~5.26 minutes of downtime per year.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA):**

- A contract between a service provider and a client outlining the expected performance and availability metrics of a system.
- SLAs define penalties or compensations if uptime guarantees are not met.
- Examples of SLA terms include:
  - Minimum uptime percentage.
  - Response time for incident resolution.
  - Scheduled maintenance periods excluded from uptime calculations.

### **3. Trade-offs Between Availability and Consistency in Distributed Systems**

**CAP Theorem:**

- States that a distributed system can achieve at most two out of three properties:
  1. **Consistency (C):** Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
  2. **Availability (A):** Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent data.
  3. **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to function even when there is a network partition.

**Trade-offs:**

- In real-world systems, availability is often prioritized over consistency to ensure uninterrupted service, especially for user-facing applications.
- Examples of availability-focused systems:
  - DNS (Domain Name System): Ensures responses are provided even if data is slightly stale.
  - Online streaming platforms: Continue serving content during network disruptions.

**Eventual Consistency:**

- A compromise where systems aim to provide consistency eventually, ensuring availability during transient inconsistencies.

### **4. Techniques to Ensure High Availability**

**Redundancy:**

- Involves duplicating critical components to eliminate single points of failure.
  - **Hardware Redundancy:** Use of multiple servers, storage systems, or network devices.
  - **Data Redundancy:** Replication of data across multiple nodes or data centers.
- Example: Active-passive setups where a standby system takes over upon primary failure.

**Failover Mechanisms:**

- Enable seamless switching from a failed component to a backup without significant downtime.
  - **Automatic Failover:** System detects failure and triggers a backup (e.g., a secondary server).
  - **Manual Failover:** Requires manual intervention to initiate backup systems.
- Example: Load balancers redirect traffic to healthy servers during failures.

**Disaster Recovery Planning:**

- Focuses on restoring operations after catastrophic events like data center outages or natural disasters.
  - **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum tolerable data loss (e.g., last 5 minutes of transactions).
  - **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Maximum allowable downtime before recovery.
- Strategies:
  - **Backup and Restore:** Periodic backups stored offsite for recovery.
  - **Cold/Warm/Hot Standby:** Levels of readiness for backup data centers.

**Other Techniques:**

- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple servers to prevent overloading.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Proactive monitoring tools to detect and resolve issues before they escalate.
- **Chaos Engineering:** Intentionally introducing failures to test system resilience and response mechanisms.

### **Key Takeaways**

- Availability is a critical aspect of system design, ensuring minimal downtime and consistent service for users.
- Uptime and SLAs are fundamental metrics for evaluating and guaranteeing system availability.
- Designing for high availability involves understanding trade-offs with consistency and implementing robust redundancy, failover, and disaster recovery mechanisms.
- Effective monitoring and proactive strategies like chaos engineering further strengthen availability efforts.
