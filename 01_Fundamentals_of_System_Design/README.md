### **1.2 Principles of Scalability, Availability, and Reliability**

1. **Scalability**
    - Definition of scalability in system design.

    - The importance of designing systems to handle growth in users, data, or traffic.
    - Techniques for achieving scalability: load balancing, partitioning, and caching.
2. **Availability**
    - Definition of availability and its role in system design.
    - Understanding uptime and SLA (Service Level Agreement).
    - Trade-offs between availability and consistency in distributed systems.
    - Techniques to ensure high availability: redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery planning.
3. **Reliability**
    - The difference between reliability and availability.
    - Importance of fault tolerance, graceful degradation, and resilience.
    - Strategies for building reliable systems: redundancy, retries, circuit breakers, and monitoring.
    - The relationship between reliability and overall system performance.
4. **Designing for Scalability, Availability, and Reliability**
    - How these principles impact each other and their trade-offs in real-world systems.
    - Example: High availability and fault-tolerant architecture for a global service (e.g., Netflix, AWS).
    - Common patterns: active-active, active-passive, and N+1 redundancy.
    - Best practices and trade-offs.

### **1.3 Key Metrics: Latency, Throughput, Response Time, etc.**

1. **Latency**
    - Definition of latency and why it's critical in system design.
    - Sources of latency in distributed systems: network latency, disk I/O, and application processing.
    - Techniques for minimizing latency: caching, data locality, content delivery networks (CDNs), and asynchronous processing.
    - Latency in the context of user experience: acceptable vs unacceptable latency.
2. **Throughput**
    - Definition of throughput and its importance in measuring system capacity.
    - Factors that affect throughput: hardware, bandwidth, and system bottlenecks.
    - Strategies to improve throughput: horizontal scaling, load balancing, and data partitioning.
3. **Response Time**
    - How response time relates to user experience and system performance.
    - Components of response time: queuing delay, processing time, and network delay.
    - Balancing response time with other metrics: reliability, scalability, and availability.
4. **Other Key Metrics**
    - Understanding additional important metrics: error rate, success rate, availability percentage, etc.
    - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for system design and monitoring.
    - How to track and measure performance using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch.
5. **Balancing Metrics**
    - Trade-offs between latency, throughput, and response time.
    - How to prioritize these metrics based on use cases (e.g., real-time systems vs batch systems).
    - Tools for monitoring system health and performance.

### **1.4 CAP Theorem and PACELC Theorem**

1. **The CAP Theorem**
    - What is the CAP Theorem?
    - Understanding the three pillars: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
    - The trade-offs: Can a system guarantee all three properties? Why or why not?
    - How to choose between consistency and availability based on use cases.
    - Real-world examples of systems that prioritize different aspects of the CAP theorem (e.g., Cassandra prioritizing availability, HBase prioritizing consistency).
2. **Partition Tolerance**
    - What does partition tolerance mean in the context of distributed systems?
    - The importance of partition tolerance in systems like databases and networked services.
    - How partition tolerance affects system design, particularly in cases of network failures and high availability systems.
3. **Real-World Applications of CAP Theorem**
    - Case study: CAP theorem application in distributed databases and services.
    - Examples of how popular systems (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB) make trade-offs between consistency and availability.
4. **The PACELC Theorem**
    - Extension of the CAP theorem: PACELC (Partition Tolerance, Availability, Consistency, Latency, and Consistency).
    - Understanding the trade-offs between latency and consistency in distributed systems.
    - Examples of how PACELC is applied in real-world systems like Amazon DynamoDB, Google Spanner, etc.

    - Potential drawbacks: performance, scalability, and availability.
2. **Eventual Consistency**
    - What is eventual consistency?
    - How eventual consistency allows data to be eventually consistent across replicas, even if there are temporary discrepancies.
